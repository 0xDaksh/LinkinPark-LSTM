So I was missing Chester Bennington this week, What I did Is I scraped all his song's lyrics individually and stored them into a file. Then I made an LSTM with Keras to achieve this, Now I can Successfuly Predict Lyrics and Generate Lyrics of Chester's Songs.

Please Download the Weights to get into the same position.
